# **Breast Cancer Prediction: Effectiveness of Resampling Techniques on the Wisconsin Dataset**

---

## ðŸ“± **About the Project**

This project focuses on evaluating the **effectiveness of resampling techniques** (Holdout, Cross-Validation, and SMOTE) in improving the performance of predictive models on the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset**.  
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Accurate prediction of whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** is crucial for early detection and treatment. By applying **resampling methods** and **Logistic Regression**, this project aims to improve prediction reliability and handle imbalanced data.

## ðŸ“‹ Dataset

- **Source**: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository).  
- **Samples**: 569 patient records.  
- **Features**: 30 features (e.g., `compactness_mean`, `area_mean`, etc.).  
- **Target**: Diagnosis (Malignant / Benign).

## ðŸ“‚ Methodology
The data analysis was carried out using RStudio with the application of various resampling techniques (Holdout, Cross-Validation), standardization (Z-Score), oversampling (SMOTE), and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) 
analysis

1. Import dataset and preprocess (`diagnosis` â†’ binary response).  
2. Define classification task (`TaskClassif$new()`).  
3. Train Logistic Regression model using **MLR3**.  
4. Evaluate with **Holdout** and **Cross Validation**.  
5. Apply **Z-Score Standardization** and **SMOTE** for class balance.  
6. Measure performance with **Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC**.  
7. Visualize results using `autoplot()` (histograms, boxplots, ROC curve).

## ðŸ“Š Results

- **Holdout**: Logistic Regression achieved ~90% accuracy.  
- **Cross Validation**: Accuracy improved to **93.32%**, showing more reliable performance.  
- **ROC-AUC**: Achieved **91.15%**, indicating strong discrimination ability between benign and malignant tumors.  

âœ… Cross Validation proved more effective than Holdout, while SMOTE improved class balance.
